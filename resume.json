      "summary": "A 25 plus year IT professional, with a deep love of science and technology,  and presently looking for an immediate position as a cloud engineer leading to technical architect. The position must be based in London, work with at least two cloud providers and company fit is more important than salary packet. My last position was four years at a London based MSP  working with physical, virtual and cloud based corporate computer/network infrastructure as a senior support engineer. After leaving Redblade/CloudDirect I believed it was important to spend time getting an agnostic view of the latest cloud technologies by certifying as Architect in all three major platforms and understanding/certifying in the latest DevOps/SRE/Security operations and techniques, with an understanding of the underlying systems of Kubernetes, data frameworks and programming. Prior to Redblade, for 14 years owner/operator for a small company in the US providing 100+ SME's with all aspects of support from desktop, to budgeting, designing and installation of computers, servers and small multi-campus networks.  The skills I'll be bringing to the company will be to provide a wealth of knowledge from many different networks & computer systems both old and new.  Understanding the important of excellent and friendly customer experience and able to present key concepts in easy to understand terms and implement a customer solution. And excellent leaning skills , with the ability to quickly pick up new concepts and skills.",
